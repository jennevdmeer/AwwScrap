# EwwScrap
Fork of [AwwScrap](https://github.com/Thraxus/AwwScrap) to only refund basic materials for use in conjunction with [scarce resources](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=831739660).

Only returning resources that can be mind on earth by replacing scrapped;
Gold > Nickel
Platinum > Cobalt
Silver > Silicon

All mod support is removed (as this is for personal use, and non of the mods listed are used) unknown items will fallback to the default iron scrap as in the original AwwScrap.

This results in having a choice to either hunt and grind for resources or just do the classic mining thing with the earth starting point.
